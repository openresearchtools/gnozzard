# Third-party software

## Resources

- Upstream: https://github.com/nokyan/resources
- Version: v1.8.0
- Commit: `0b0dfbc29b1295211493a4daadb005fa3d8a5555`
- License: GPL-3.0-or-later
- Location: `third_party/resources`

v1.8.0 is intentionally pinned because it supports GTK 4.10 and libadwaita
1.6, matching Debian 13. Later upstream versions require libadwaita 1.8.
Its AppStream metadata and `.typos.toml` retain their CC0-1.0 licences.

## Adwaita folder artwork

- Upstream: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/adwaita-icon-theme
- License: LGPL-3.0-only (also offered upstream under CC-BY-SA-3.0-US)
- Location: `data/icons/Gnozzard`

The scalable folder silhouette is GNOME Adwaita's native folder artwork with
only its blue colour values changed to the Gnozzard orange palette. GNOME
Project attribution is retained here and in the SVG source comments.
